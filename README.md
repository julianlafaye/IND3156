Have had some trouble connecting to the Pi again, not sure what happened but not recognizing my login anymore. So I might just reinstall a new OS and start from there but I do not have the tools to do that so I'll try and figure out a way around that while countiuning to work on my code.

As far as my code goes I am having trouble returning the values for humidity and tempurature as it seems to be stored as two values one for the integer value and one for the decimals, and I am trying to figure out how to return them both as one value.
